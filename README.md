## Concept
Adventure Quest is a two person cooperative async turn based adventure game. The style of play is similar to Dungeons & Dragons where players face turning points in the story, make choices as to how to proceed, and a random dice roll determines which player's choice wins. The winning choice either leads to success or peril for both of the players. Adventure Quest also incorporates live chat between the players, and game rooms so that multiple games can be ongoing simultaneously.
